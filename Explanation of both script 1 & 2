Script 1:

In script 1, we first import the Active Directory module, which allows us to query for user objects in Active Directory. 
We then set the output file path where the results will be saved. We query for all admin users by using the Get-ADUser cmdlet 
and filtering for users who are members of the built-in Administrators group and are currently enabled. We select the desired 
properties for the output file and export the results to a CSV file using the Export-CSV cmdlet.

Script 2:

In script 2, we import the Azure Active Directory module, which allows us to query for user objects in Azure Active Directory.
We set the input file path where the results from script 1 are saved. We read the CSV file using the Import-CSV cmdlet and loop 
through each admin user using a foreach loop. For each user, we extract their email address and use the Get-AzureADUserAuthenticationMethod
cmdlet to query for their authentication methods. We then filter the results to find if multifactor authentication is enabled for the user.
If it is, we output a message saying so. If not, we output a message indicating that MFA is not enabled.
