The output of the first PowerShell script will be a CSV file containing information about all admin users who are members 
of the built-in Administrators group and currently enabled. The file will be saved to a predetermined location on the system.

The output of the second PowerShell script will be a list of admin users and whether they have multifactor authentication enabled or not.
This information will be displayed in the PowerShell console. If desired, the output can be piped to a file or exported to another CSV file for further processing.
